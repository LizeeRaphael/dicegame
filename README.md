🎲 Dice Game 

A simple browser-based dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice DOM manipulation and game logic.



🔍 Overview 

This game simulates a two-player dice roll. When the user clicks the "Roll Dice" button, each player rolls a die. The game then determines the winner based on the higher dice value, or declares a draw if the values match.
